Udacity Data Engeneering Nanodegree Program - My Submission of the Capstone Project

## Impact of the Covid19 Pandemic on Mobility in Germany

The goal of this project is to bring together current data on the Covid19 pandemic, governmental measures against it, vaccination and mobility in Germany.

The data is stored in star schemata (two dimension and two facts tables) and is ready for analysis.

##### The project follows the follow steps:
1. Scope the Project and Gather Data
1. Explore and Assess the Data
1. Define the Data Model
1. Run ETL to Model the Data
1. Complete Project Write Up


The Project's steps are in the [capstone_project.ipynb](https://github.com/FutureTroglodyte/udacity-nd027-capstone_project/blob/master/capstone_project.ipynb) which is self-explanatory. Also there is a [data_dictionary.md](https://github.com/FutureTroglodyte/udacity-nd027-capstone_project/blob/master/data_dictionary.md) for the raw data sets.
